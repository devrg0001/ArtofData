In this assignment, I was tasked to answer the following questions based on a research paper I read. The paper I chose was one that aligned with my interests in economics, specifically, the paper talked about the consequences of becoming climate neutral. 
Specifically this paper explores what might actually happen to rich and poor people if governments, especially in the European Union, push for their big climate plans like the "Fit-for-55" policy, which aims to cut net carbon emissions to zero. The paper explores a new side to the climate-fighting arguments, 
We often hear about how fighting climate change is a good thing for everyone. But these new policies usually mean that things like electricity, gas, and heating get more expensive, because much of our energy still comes from carbon-heavy sources. The big question the paper addresses is Does this hurt low-income people more than the wealthy?
The paper’s name is “Distributional Consequences of Becoming Climate-Neutral” and is authored by Philipp Hochmuth, Per Krusell, and Kurt Mitman
So to answer this question, they built a computer model that simulates an economy where there are just two types of people: "rich" agents (who earn a lot and spend a small portion of their money on energy) and "poor" agents (who earn less but spend a big share on energy).
They then simulated what happens when a strict climate policy is put in place (making dirty energy expensive but not yet providing any energy alternatives). Their findings were extremely interesting. What they found is that the poor people suffer the most.  Poor people could be 50% more negatively affected by these policies compared to rich people. The paper looks at government compensation, like giving out cash, so nobody is worse off. But, in practice, it’s impossible to fully “pay back” all the losers, especially while reaching strict climate targets. Some will inevitably end up worse off. They also found that such a Climate policy causes an economic shock. Their model predicts that the overall economy (GDP) would drop as much as 9.3% after a big climate policy, mainly because it suddenly becomes harder and more expensive to produce things.  With this context in mind, here are the answers to the questions I was assigned, 

1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses?

* Null hypothesis: The distributional burden of a climate-neutral transition (e.g., the EU’s Fit-for-55 package) will not be unevenly distributed between poor and rich people; basically, both sets of people are affected similarly by policy measures that raise the costs of emission-intensive energy.
* Alternative hypothesis: The distributional burden is uneven, with poorer people suffering a greater loss than richer ones after climate neutral policies, due to higher relative energy expenditure shares among the poor.

2. Who is collecting and analyzing this data?

The authors of this research paper, Philipp Hochmuth, Per Krusell, and Kurt Mitman and are backed by their institute, IZA – Institute of Labor Economics, Institute for International Economic Studies (Stockholm University), and affiliates

3. What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?

The data is from Eurostat (Experimental statistics on income, consumption and wealth) for 2015, which
compiles information from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS). It is avalible publicly at this link - https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/experimental-statistics/income-consumption-wealth

4. Why are they interested in this data?

They want to “focus on household inequality in the context of
The green transition,” which is why getting data on the expenditures, consumption, etc, of households is extremely important, which is what this dataset is about. 	

5. What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?

* Recorded data in the study:
    * Model parameters (preference structures, energy use)
    * Simulation results for agents’ welfare, GDP, energy use across policy scenarios
    * Projected changes in GDP, welfare, and inequality indicators under different tax/subsidy regimes
* What might be left out:
    * Micro-level household data (specific family or company details)
    * Country-level heterogeneity, as the model simplifies to two representative agents (rich and poor)


6. What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?

They primarly presented Model-based evidence such as 
    * Simulated trajectories of GDP, welfare, and energy use for two people types under varying climate policies.
    * Quantitative predictions: e.g., GDP falls 9.3% after the Fit-for-55 policy, and the poor agent is 50% more negatively affected than the rich agent.
    * Sensitivity checks by varying parameters, e.g., rates of energy efficiency increase required to offset policy losses.

7. How was this study funded?

* IZA - Institute of Labor Economics provided institutional support/publication. But no explicit grant is listed for the research paper, 


8. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?

Personally, I originally thought it may have been a study like that since all the evidence is based on a model that they could change parameters of to get a significant result, but I researched more into this series of papers, which was published as part of a respected working paper series (IZA Discussion Papers), so I believe the publication is more legitimate and reputable. I also ran a lot of the math through different sources for the model to get a better understanding, so I think it has been done out of genuine results, not publish or perish motivations. I think the paper likely aligns with broader academic/institutional incentives to publish impactful work. However, the careful model construction and policy analysis suggest a substantive research motivation, not just “publish or perish” pressures.
