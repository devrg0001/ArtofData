The following is my expereince and answers to lab 1 of my art of data class.

Average speed (Spd): 120.40160642570281

Number of Vaccine-type Digimon: 70

Sample valid team: Ogremon, Kuwagamon

In this lab, I was tasked with finding the answers to 3 questions about the average speed of digimons, number of vaccine type digimona and a sample team that would have 15 memory or less with 300 attack or more with up to 3 characters.

For the answer to the first question I used the following snippet of python code- 

![hi, this image did not work]({{'/assets/img/code3.jpg'|relative_url}})


Here's an explantion behind the first section. Firstly, we open up the file and read it using csv reader. Then we define 2 variables one tracking the overall speed and one tracking the number of digimon. We then iterate through the csv file, adding the speed of a charcter to the overall speed and then adding 1 to total digmon count which here is just the variable count. Then we divide the total speed by count to arrive at the average speed. 


For the answer to the second question I used the following snippet of python code- 

![]({{ '/assets/img/code2.jpg' | relative_url }})


In the second part where i had to find vaccine type digimon, i wrote a code that allowed me to search for any type, attribute etc and would work, not only for sorting through type and vaccine, i did it by having 3 fields and a count which updated after seeing one of the thing we are searching for like in this case vaccine type's. This extra line of code at the end specifies which thing the code should search for and count - print("Number of Vaccine-type Digimon:", count_digimon("Type", "Vaccine", data))


For the answer to the third question I used the following snippet of python code- 

![]({{'/assets/img/code1.jpg'|relative_url}})


Here, the code goes through all combinations of either a team that fit the critera with just 1 digimon, 2 digimon or 3 digimons. I checked the valid team and it did indeed meet the threshold needed, as it had 14 memory and 300+ attack, best of all it was only 2 characters not 3. 

Across this lab, which was introductory in nature, I didn't need to work with anyone else as we all had a good idea of what we had to do. I tried intially hardocding things in and then worked backwards to remove those and make it more unhardcoded and useful for other purposes. I think I did a good job with the code, except with code for challenge number 3 which was the team, i feel like it was very long and slightly complex and I could have tried and figured out a diffrent way to approach that. Apart from that, I learned a lot about python, how to read csv files and get insights from their data such as counts etc without hvaing to use things like pandas, and just doing it based on pure logic and simple functions. I also learnt how to build a solution that could be applied to multiple diffrent versions of the same problem instead of just solving 1 specifc thing and having to redo for any variation of that. 


Thanks for reading
